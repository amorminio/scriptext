This is an angular project to expand my skills with angular / css / html5 and SVG elements.



# Default Angular Project
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
